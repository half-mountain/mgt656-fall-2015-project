<h2>Accomplishments, Challenges, and Roadblocks</h2>

<p>In our sprint planning meeting, we collectively sized each of the stories we sought to accomplish during Sprint 2, moving them from the product backlog to the “ready” workflow in Waffle.io. From there, we assigned each of these stories amongst all five members of our team. Some team members took ownership of one large story (e.g. “API should return an array of upcoming events in JSON format”), while other team members were assigned several smaller stories (e.g. many components of the homepage stories). This gave us a clear sense of what code we were each responsible for writing over the course of the week.</p>

<p>Throughout the sprint, we communicated using a team chat on Slack. By documenting our work in Waffle.io, we each received e-mail updates of the stories that our teammates had moved from “in progress” to “done” in the workflow. All of us were able to set up our Cloud9 environments, familiarize ourselves with the starter code, and run working applications on our computers. </p>

<p>One challenge we did not take into account at the beginning of the sprint the set-up time necessary for everyone to get on the same page in terms of familiarity with the models-views-controllers structure and the code contained within each of components. We mistakenly frontloaded the project with a heavy size of stories without accounting for this initial time of getting our feet wet in the code. In order to work through questions and bugs, we utilized both the Slack group chat and short in-person meetings to identify our blockers and help each other get unblocked. </p>

<p>Through this process, we were able to accomplish several small stories that summed up to a functional homepage. After running the tests, the code at the end of this sprint was able to pass all tests related to the homepage. The path at ‘/’ led to the homepage, which displayed an unordered list of events with correct time tags and a link for further details. The homepage excluded events that had already passed, and included a placeholder team logo (until a new one is designed) and a link to create a new event.</p>

<h2>Product Backlog (in the order they will be completed)</h2>

<ol>
<li>API: As a user, I can use your API at /api/events.</li>
<li>About: As a user, I can learn about the company through an About page.</li>
<li>Design: As any user, I can visit the url at / and see a website that looks good.</li>
<li>Details: As any user, I can see event details on a separate page when I click on an event.</li>
<li>RSVP: As an attendee, I can visit the event detail page to RSVP for an event.</li>
<li>New: As a user I can create new events.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress Expected by Next Sprint</h2>

<ol>
<li>API should allow for searching events by title.</li>
<li>About page should have headshots, tagged correctly.</li>
<li>About page should have each of our names, tagged correctly.</li>
<li>A team logo should be designed.</li>
<li>All pages should be using Bootstrap CSS.</li>
<li>All pages should have a link to /about in the footer</li>
<li>Event details (title, date, # of people, photo) should be displayed on a separate page when an event is clicked on the homepage.</li>
</ol>
